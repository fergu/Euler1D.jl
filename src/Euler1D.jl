"""
    cycle!( output::Simulation{T}, input::Simulation{T}, Δt::T ) where { T <: AbstractFloat }

Perform one timestep (cycle) of the solution process.

# Returns
`nothing`. Modifies the `output` argument in-place.

# Parameters
- `output`: A `Simulation{T}` where the state at the next timestep will be stored. Modified in-place by this function.
- `input`: A `Simulation{T}` representing the state at the beginning of the timestep.
- `Δt`: The size of the timestep. That is, the amount of time the solution is advanced in one cycle.

# Notes
- This function is generally not intended to be called directly. Instead, use the various time-stepping functions defined in `Timestepping.jl` such as [`AdvanceOneCycle()`](@ref), [`AdvanceNCycles()`](@ref), or [`AdvanceToTime()`](@ref).
- Time integration in this function is performed using a first-order forward Euler scheme.

# Side Effects
- Modifies all of the time-dependent fields (e.g. velocity, energy, and EOS-derived fields) of the `output` argument in-place while leaving constant fields (e.g., mass, gamma) unchanged.
