    AdvanceToTime( state::Simulation{T}, stoptime::T, Δt::T; exact::Bool=false ) where { T <: AbstractFloat }

Advance the simulation with initial state `state` to a time specified by `stoptime` with a fixed timestep. 

# Returns
A `Simulation{T}` representing the state at the end of the final cycle.

# Arguments
- `input`: A `Simulation{T}` representing the simulation state at the start of the first cycle.
- `stoptime`: The time to advance to. (Unit: s)
- `Δt`: The timestep size. (Unit: s)
- `exact`: If true, try to stop as close as possible to `stoptime` by adjusting the final timestep size (Default: `false`)

# Notes
- The current simulation time is determined by the `Simulation` field `state.time`. If `state.time > stoptime`, no steps will be taken.
- This function allocates two `deepcopy()`s of the input state and returns the copy corresponding to the final state.
- This function simply calls `AdvanceOneCycle!` repeatedly until the simulation time reaches `stoptime`. The primary advantage to using this function as opposed to [`AdvanceOneCycle()`](@ref) or [`AdvanceNCycles()`](@ref) is that various backing arrays are pre-allocated to improve speed.
- If `exact=true`, the timestep of the final cycle is adjusted so that the time of the final state is as close as possible to `stoptime`.
